# Liv’s guide to frame upscaling with Davinci Resolve

For this example, I’m going to upscale a 25 fps video into 50 fps.

## Step 1
Create a new project. 
Go to `File > Project Settings`. 
In `Timeline frame rate`, select 50 fps. 
Import the footage onto the timeline. 

## Step 2
Since this is a 25 fps video inside a 50 fps video, the frame will update on every other frame.
